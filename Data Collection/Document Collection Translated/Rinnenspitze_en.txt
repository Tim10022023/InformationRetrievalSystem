The hut is located at 2,147 meters above sea level. The approach takes place by the Oberissalm in the rear Oberbergtal, a side valley of the Stubai Valley (about an hour and a half of the time), and it is also a stuba hut of the Stubaier HÃ¶henweg. The relatively large hut offers many touring opportunities in the area. Numerous peaks and also via ferratas can be conquered from here. All information about the hut can be found here: Franzsennhuette.at

Mountain tour highlight

A beautiful mountain with an impressive sight when you have reached the top. The last piece is not very easy to create with enough sure -footedness. Rope protection and kicks are available. A helmet should always be there.
