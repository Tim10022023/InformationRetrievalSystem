You can find the cable car station and a restaurant directly below the summit of Monte Cimetta. Very nice and picturesque place and the surrounding area. I recommend an ascent to Cimetta, think about the possibility of different excursions from here. Find out more about the sports offer in the restaurant because it can be very full in the summer months.

The Cimetta is the local mountain of Locarno. Grandiose views of Lake Maggiore and the surrounding valleys shape every tour up to the Cimetta. Very worthwhile!

Alpe Carcada is a very famous place near the stallone. An alm full of services thanks to the restaurant, the view and an environment that sells any tiredness. Keep in mind that it is very popular in the high season.
