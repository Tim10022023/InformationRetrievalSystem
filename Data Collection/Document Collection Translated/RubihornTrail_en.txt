To achieve exhausting, but not so overcrowded. Wonderful nature! The lake is of course cold, but you can swim in summer.

The Lower Gaisalpsee is a high mountain lake at a height of 1,508 meters in the AllgÃ¤u Alps, northeast below the Rubihorn. The three and a half hectare lake drains into the Iller via the Gaisalpbach.
The lake is located on the hiking trail from Reichenbach to the Nebelhorn via the Gaisalpe, Lower and Upper Gaisalpsee, GaisfuÃŸsattel, GroÃŸe Gund and Edmund-Probst-Haus.
