View of the Nedersee

Wonderful view of the beautiful Nedersee and the rugged mountains. The ascent to the summit is demanding and leads through rubble, sure -footedness and alpine experience are necessary.

Nederkogel

Hiking highlight

Recommended by 10 wandering

If you would like to climb a 3,000 and you are not sure, then the Nederkogel is exactly right. If it gets too much, the Nedersee is a worthwhile goal.

Also good for families. My wife and child are along to the lake. I treated myself to the summit alone. But still it is a 3,000 that you should only climb and not underestimate in good, stable weather.

The reward is a fantastic panorama! Unfortunately, the photos can do that badly, so climb and enjoy yourself. ;)
