Suspension bridge

Hiking highlight

126 out of 130 wandering recommend this

At the edge of the hiking trail to the summit, this suspension bridge can be discovered at the beginning/end of a via ferrata. It is perhaps 10 to 15 meters long and, in my view, only passable for experienced climbers. You also know fans of the ZDF series the mountain rescuers as a spectacular location.

The rustic Gröbminger Alm lies at the foot of the stoder tines and spoils you with delicious delicacies and a fantastic view. The hut can be reached on foot, by bike or car.
