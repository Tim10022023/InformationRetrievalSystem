The hiking trail leads from the Juifen to the valley over wide mountain meadows. When the weather is clear, you can enjoy a fantastic view to the glaciated peaks of the Hohe Tauern.

Juifen

Hiking highlight

Recommended by 15 wandering

The summit of the Juifen grants a great 360 degree view and it is also possible almost all year round, with moderate snow conditions. It is particularly recommended as a combined bike-hike tour on which the wheel can be used to the Marbichler Joch.

There is no restaurant in the Falkenmoosalm today, but a visit to the rustic Alm is worthwhile just because of the wonderful view. So you simply enjoy your snack on the alpine meadow.
