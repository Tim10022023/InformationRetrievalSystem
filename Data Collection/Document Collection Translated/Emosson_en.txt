Breathtaking views, you feel like you are in another world.

Warning: Do not try to hike on the other bank of the LAC du Vieux Emosson unless you have good alpine equipment and hiking experience. There are unpaved roads and dead ends so that they cannot walk around.

A nice destination along the Lac d 'Emosson reservoir to the higher lying reservoir LAC du Vieux Emosson leads on the well -developed road. The archery with the height of 180 meters was built between 1967 and 1974. From the dam you have a great view of Mount Blanc. You can reach the reservoir by car, bus or narrow -gauge railway.
