Very nice viewing summit and local mountain from BartholomÃ¤berg in the Montafon. Beautiful panoramic view of the summit prominence within a radius of 10 to 20 kilometers! The last meters are secured with steel ropes.

Small, idyllic mountain lake in the middle of Almwiesen. There are also a few rustic alpine huts and the rugged peaks of the RÃ¤tikon in the distance - the perfect alpine panorama is ready.
