From Aeschiried to Greberegg, further via the Brunnialp to the Morgenberghorn ... a strenuous hike with great views and an impressive 360 â€‹â€‹degree panorama on the summit.

At the hut you can take a cozy break and refresh yourself with a cool drink. Overnight stays are also possible, but you should register for this beforehand. The hut is closed in winter. It is best to find out about the opening times before your hike. You can reach the hut host at +41 (0) 77 438 08 65.
