Vettisfossen is Norway's highest freely falling waterfall. Embedded in the breathtaking Utladal valley, Vettisfossen falls impressive in a single, uninterrupted case 275 meters.

Regardless of whether the hike leads to the other side of the river or not, testing the suspension bridge is worth it either way.

Beautiful waterfall of the Utla below Vetti Gard. Who dares to go into the water here?
