The lake is often left left, but wrongly! Not too attractive from the west side, but coming from the east, you can be very lucky and see great water mirrors.

Hiking highlight Wildsee-lies on the 5-lake hike!
We are high from Wangs from the gondola and chairlift to the Pizolhütte (CHF 46 CHF and down) to make the panoramic high path and then the 5-sea hike. After a short detour to Lake Wangsersee, the 5-sea hike begins with a crunchy climb over well-walking rubble and ends with an unforgettable view of the Wildsee with its magically bluish color. Even if the lake highlight is already here, the remaining, varied tour with constantly new, breathtaking panoramic pipes and three other lakes (including the also impressive Schottensee) offers more than enough to make the hearts of mountain fans happy.
Absolutely recommended and if possible, companies during the week.

Schottensee

If you start early and hike the tour in the opposite order, you will only find a few other hikers at Schottensee, with a little luck, before it is teeming with people at Wildsee.

One lake beautiful than the other, but everyone unique. The Schwarzsee makes its name honor and shimmers darkly in sunlight.

Rising from Schwarzsee to a plateau with many stone men. From there you have a wonderful view in all directions.

Lake Baschalva

Hiking highlight

From Lake Baschalva you can see to the Rhine Valley, whereby this becomes irrelevant when you see this beautiful Bergsee. Depending on which direction you make the 5-lake hike, this is the first or last of the five lakes on the hike.

Rustic inn with delicious food. After the strenuous descent or ascent, it is worth returning here.
