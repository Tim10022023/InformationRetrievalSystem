Beautiful mountain lake in the middle of the Alpstein, with a panorama that could not have been created better on the computer. Free -running cows, light green sparkling water, cheese dairy, alphorn players ... heart, what more do you want?

Fählensee

The spot lake is the third largest mountain lake in the canton of Appenzell and is located in a very narrow valley cut between the Berggasthof Bollenwees and the Zwinglipass, embedded between Hundsteingrat and Roslen-Saxer-First. Simply beautiful. Highly recommended!

Sämtisersee

Hiking highlight

Seastis lake at 1200 meters
As with the Fählensee, no drain can be seen here. The water of both lakes flows underground from the UND and reveals again in the Rhine Valley. Drainage or not, enjoy a refreshing bath!
The water mirror fluctuates strongly, which is why the Sämtis Lake in very hot summer sometimes dries out almost.
