Front Lahngangsee

Hiking highlight

In the middle of the Dead Mountains, on the way from Grundlsee to the Pühringerhütte or to the Albert-Appelhaus you will pass the two Lahngang lakes. This one, the front, lets you step up to its bank and reveals wonderful views of its deep blue water and the dreamlike nature all around.

Rear Lahngangsee

Hiking highlight

Recommended by 42 wandering

Here you can enjoy a clear view of the rear Lahngangsee. It is much smaller than the front Lahngangsee and difficult to access for hikers. The nature and summit of the Dead Mountains all around make it a nice place to pause briefly.
