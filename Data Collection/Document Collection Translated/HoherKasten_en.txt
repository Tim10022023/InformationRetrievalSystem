Turning restaurant high box
Just sit down and enjoy the "rondom". In the only rotary restaurant of Eastern Switzerland on the high box, guests experience a limitless, changing 360 ¬∞ view. While the view extends from the impressive backdrop of the alpine to the lovely Appenzellerland to the vastness of Lake Constance, we spoil you with seasonal and regional specialties.
From April to February, the rotary restaurant is open daily during the operation of the cable car and is easily accessible for guests with restricted mobility with a lift.

The spot lake is the third largest mountain lake in the canton of Appenzell and is located in a very narrow valley cut between the Berggasthof Bollenwees and the Zwinglipass, embedded between Hundsteingrat and Roslen-Saxer-First. Simply beautiful. Highly recommended!
