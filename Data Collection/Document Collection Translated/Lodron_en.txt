The Austrian writer Sepp Kahn lives on the Lärchenbergalm in the summer months. The 67-year-old is considered a representative of ironic peasant literature. Maybe you will meet him in his summer domicile and can philosophize with him about his anecdotes and stories.

Steinberghaus (Steinberg inn)

Hiking highlight

52 out of 57 wandering recommend this

The Steinberg inn in the Windautal is a great starting point for your hikes. After an eventful day in the mountains, you can be pampered with Tyrolean home cooking. If you want to hike in the area for several days, you can stay in one of the rooms.
