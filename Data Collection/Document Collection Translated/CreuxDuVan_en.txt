Noiraigue
The first written mention of the place dates to the year 998 under the name Nigra Aqua. This Latin word with the meaning of black water describes the water of the noiraigue, which is often darkly clouded by the moor floors in the VallÃ©e des Ponts, the catchment area of â€‹â€‹the karst source. The area around Noiraigue was already committed in the Neolithic, which is attested by the discovery of a hatchet from this time.
Noiraigue belonged to the Priorat Saint-Pierre in MÃ´tiers until the 14th century, after which it was subordinate to the Kastlei Val-de-Travers until 1848. During this time, the county of NeuchÃ¢tel held sovereignty over the area. NeuchÃ¢tel was connected to the Kingdom of Prussia since 1648 and from 1707 by personal union. In 1806 the area was ceded to Napoleon I and came to the Swiss Confederation in 1815 in the course of the Vienna Congress, with the Kings of Prussia to the NeuchÃ¢tel trade in NeuchÃ¢tel in 1857. In 1719 numerous houses were victims of a village fire.

Not a nice or gratifying sight, but interesting and unusual.
It is astonishing what Switzerland created in the 1930s: de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Sperrstellen_in_der_Schweiz

Impressive place full of strength and unique nature.
The rise from Noiraigue to Creux du van is exhausting and steep, the view and magic of this place, but compensate for the hardships. If you have enough energy, you can then descend to the Gorges de l`Areuse and hike through the beautiful gorge to Boudry.

The Berggasthof Fermen Robert, built in 1750 at the foot of the Creux du van, was 972 meters high. It is the ideal stop on the way to the Creux du van. In addition to the interior, there are large tables and a playground as well as an enclosure with goats. Children find beautiful play opportunities there. A tourist accommodation is around 50 meters from Ferme Robert.
