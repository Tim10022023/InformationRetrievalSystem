Before you reach the summit - at a height of around 750 m high of the 831 m high Himmelindan hike, you have a very good view of the beach. Good place to take a break, eat a snack and prepare for the last part

The view of Haukland Beach and the surrounding mountains, as well as the sea are stunning. Right "lofoten feeling" comes up here ;-)
