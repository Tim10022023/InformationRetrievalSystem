The Olpererh√ºtte at 2,389 meters offers an excellent overnight stay to climb higher peaks. There are sleeping places for five people each, and you have to bring sleeping bags.

The restaurant is also recommended and offers a diverse selection at human prices. After a hard day in the mountains, you can enjoy delicious meals here and experience the cosiness of the hut.

A must on a hike to the Olpererh√ºtte. In good weather, there are wonderful, unforgettable photo opportunities. You should be up here around noon, because then the snake of those who also want to take a photo grows. The path and the waiting are worthwhile.
