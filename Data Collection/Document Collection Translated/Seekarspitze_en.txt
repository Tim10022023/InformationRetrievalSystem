Hiking trail to the Seakarspitze

Hiking highlight (section)

The ascent to the Seakarspitze on Lake Achensee is a popular but demanding mountain tour with steep and rocky paths, the closer you get the summit. The tour offers spectacular views of the Achensee and the Karwendelgebirge, but is only suitable for experienced mountaineers.

The entire route comprises about 14 kilometers and you can handle around 1,200 meters of altitude. Especially in summer you should start early to avoid the midday heat and plan enough breaks. Surefootedness and a head for heights are essential in this way because some passages are narrow and exposed.

Great view of the Achensee and the surrounding mountains. Highly recommended! The sometimes (but) hard climb is definitely worth it !!! üòÄ‚õ∞Ô∏è

It is best to make from north to south (from Achenkirch to PertiSau), you have the sun from the front, more beautiful looks and the more difficult areas on the climb.

A summit with a wonderful view. If you still have strength, you can continue to go to the lake cheese tip.

The Seekaralm is primarily used for agriculture, in second place it serves as a refreshment point. You can get cheese or bacon bread and fresh milk here. With the magnificent view, this tastes twice as good.
