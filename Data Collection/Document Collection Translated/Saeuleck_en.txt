Not too far from the parking lot in the Döstental you pass the way to the sower trolley past an idyllic water, the Konradlacke. Here you can rest again in a great natural backdrop before it continues steeply uphill to the Arthur von Schmid-Haus.

Recommended by 19 wandering

Little difficult, very varied, high alpine mountain hike in a unique landscape. However, condition is required-also possible with an overnight stay in the Arthur von Schmid house. For the last last upswing over the south ridge, sure -footedness and a head for heights are necessary.

Arthur-von-Schmid-Haus

Hiking highlight

The protective hut of the Austrian Alpine Club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011. The large mountain hut is right next to the Dösener See in the middle of the Hohe Tauern National Park. The hut is a perfect starting point for other mountain tours.
