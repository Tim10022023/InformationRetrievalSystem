Fantastically beautiful lake, framed by several two and three thousands. Due to the not too difficult increase, this is a goal for the whole family. You should wear firmer footwear. Gastronomy and boat rental are also available.

Wonderful path high above the Oeschinensee

Hiking highlight (section)

Not so without without the path above the lake. We still had snow and thereby there were two places where it was a little more dangerous. Otherwise you should be free of heights and some sure -footedness and good footwear are recommended. Otherwise great path with a breathtaking view.
