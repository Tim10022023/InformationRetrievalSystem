The tree alone with the many shoes at the starting point is worth a visit. You can also eat and sleep there nicely. The valley around Steinberg is very nice and offers many opportunities for demanding hikes. There are only two difficult paths on the Guffert from Steinberg. You are alone there, I only met two small groups, but chamois and a lot of sheep. There is no rest hut or a stop on the entire path. Sticks are recommended.

Steep and rocky it goes up to the promising summit. Sure and solid hiking shoes are in demand here. Sometimes you have to use your hands.
