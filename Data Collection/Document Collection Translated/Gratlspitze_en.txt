Difficult hike. Very good condition required. Mostly easy to walk. Supposure required. The starting point of the tour is directly at a parking lot.

Very nice way to stop to enjoy a cool drink. Of course you can also eat a meal here. The Holzalm is also easy to reach with children. And the view rounds off the whole thing perfectly. A clear recommendation for every hiker! :)

Great view 360 degrees, worthwhile increase. You can see a large Venice and Zillertal Alps.
