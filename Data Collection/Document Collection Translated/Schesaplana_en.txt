A beautiful lake. He was rightly elected in 2019 in the program "9 Places - 9 treasures" for Austria. And even with the cable car, which is newly renovated, you can get up easily and quickly. But there is also a mountain path from the valley station that leads upwards. Almost 400 meters of altitude must be mastered. A very nice hiking trail leads around the lake. Fishing is also worthwhile. But you need a permit for this.

In any case, it is emphasized to climb the Schesplana. Grandiose view

Schesaplana

The tedious increase is rewarded with an obstacleless 360-degree panorama. By far the highest mountain of the Rätikon overrides its neighboring peaks. It is not for nothing that the summit cross bears the inscription "You are the Lord of the mountains and the king of the summits". The next higher mountain is over 30 kilometers away in the silvretta group.

From the border you have a beautiful view of Lünersee. But be careful: turn off roaming on the cell phone, otherwise the provider gambles the Swiss Fränklis!

After the complete destruction of the Totalphütte by an avalanche in spring 2019, it has now been rebuilt and invites you to eat too. The hospitality is nice and friendly. Nature simply indescribable. It is not for nothing that the Lünersee was elected to the most beautiful place. Just run and be happy.
