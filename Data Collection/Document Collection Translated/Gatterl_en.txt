Gatterl

Hiking highlight

The Gatterl is a remarkable border crossing between Germany and Austria with a great view of the Reintal, the Zugspitze and the surrounding mountain ranges. The path from the German side is bare, full of rubble and leads to the KnorrhÃ¼tte. After a short climbing, there is a landscape of green mountain slopes in which many small streams arise. Both sides and the Gatterl are absolutely recommended!

KnorrhÃ¼tte

A rustic hut of the Alpine Club in the middle of the scree field in front of the Zugspitze. Here you have a beautiful view of the green Rein Valley, but also on the rocky peaks of the surrounding mountains. Kindly, you can also fill up your water supplies here. ðŸ˜Š

If you want to pause a little longer here, you can stay in the small restaurant for eating or spend the night in the hut. A little break, whether short or long, should be planned in any case. ðŸ˜‰

The KnorrhÃ¼tte is "guarded" by sheep :) Until then, the way coming out of the valley is still easy to go, after that it will be demanding.
