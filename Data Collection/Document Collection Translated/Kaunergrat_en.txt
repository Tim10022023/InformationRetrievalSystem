Plangeross in the Pitztal

Hiking highlight

Plangeross in the Pitztal is simply a hiking paradise. Many tours have the starting point or end in the small town. Whether to the Kaunergrathütte, to the Rüsselsheimer Hütte, or just a hike to the next town in the valley. You will rave about the dreamlike nature of this area every time.

Lussbachfall near Plangeross

Hiking highlight

54 out of 58 wandering recommend this

You can reach the Lussbach waterfall from Plangeross in about 20 minutes. Since the Lussbach receives its water from the surrounding glaciers, it is particularly impressive in early summer. The waterfall itself is approximately 15 meters, but the entire stream falls down the slope over several steps 200 meters. Very impressive!

Hiking highlight

Continuously steep, but demanding all the more great if you take a break and look at the way back to the previous way. The entire Pitztal region is just a perfect playground for all mountaineer and hikers.

Kaunergrathütte

Hiking highlight

The Kaunergrathütte is the highest mountain hut in the Pitztal. Located at 2,817 meters, it is embedded between the striking Watzespitze and the peak tip. As a shelter, it offers shelter for over 60 guests. We stayed at the Kaunergrathütte and were very satisfied. The inviting sun terrace in particular gave us a pleasant end to the day after the march on the Pitztaler Almenweg.

Opening times: mid -June to mid -September
