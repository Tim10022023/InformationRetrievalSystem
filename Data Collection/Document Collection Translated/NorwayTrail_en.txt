A small, very idyllic Waldsee, not far from the viewpoint on the Fløyen.

The path to the Fløyen viewing platform begins in one of the most beautiful districts of Bergen. Pittoreske houses line the way. After that, it slowly goes through the forest with a little climb. You are up at the top in less than 40 minutes. The view is incredible. When the weather is good, you can see over the offshore islands to the Atlantic. Apart from the crowds, there is nothing to complain about. Since the train runs until 11 p.m., you can still enjoy the sun's course at the top, because in July the sun does not go under before 10:30 p.m.

From here it goes by train to the mountain, from which you have a great view of the city. If you have bought the ticket online, you can avoid a large part of the queue.
