Hiking highlight

In the middle of meadows and forests is the beautiful mountain inn Sattelbauer. From here you have a great view of the mountains all around, such as the Grießenkar or the mighty Dachstein massif. In the cozy inn you can enjoy hearty cuisine with regional dishes. You can find more information at Sattelbauer.at.

Lackenalm

Hiking highlight

A wonderfully idyllic alp with a great view and a cozy hut that has opened continuously and in which you can enjoy delicious, rustic dishes. Incidentally, the name "Lackenalm" comes from the numerous "varnishes": This is how small puddles or water that only exist at times - if it has rained, the beautiful landscape is reflected here in countless paints.

When you drive to Flachau, the Lackenkogel involuntarily attracts your eyes: the green summit is impressive above the valley - however, it is even more impressive to stand up here and enjoy the breathtaking view down! The steep climb is always worthwhile.
