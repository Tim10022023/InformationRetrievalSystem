Info Center around the glacier, great exhibition and lots of information about the glacier, its origin and retreat. Alternatively, after the hike, you can just drink a coffee with a view of the nigardsbree.

Here you can only get over a small toll road. There are toilets and a jetty to get closer to the glacier by boat.

Tour to the glacier

Hiking highlight

From here about 3 km to the glacier. Varied path over rocks, watercourses, ladders, partially secured.
You should be sure -footed, solid shoes with a gripy sole are also recommended here.
Also feasible for children from about 5 years.
Take the jacket and possibly headgear even in warm temperatures, the last 500m to the glacier are cold and windy!

Bridge over the glacier river

Hiking highlight

Recommended by 84 wandering

The bridge is like a temperature limit: behind the bridge it becomes significantly colder and windy. A jacket and possibly hat make sense here in summer!
