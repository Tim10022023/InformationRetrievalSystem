Passing rocks leads up a narrow climb, a wire rope also ensures security.

Modern hut with a striking roof shape on the south side of the Krummbachstein. The Knofeleben Naturfreundehaus was opened in 2012 after the former hut was unfortunately burned down. The cozy rooms are bright and very clean. Monday is the day off.

All information is available at Knofeleben.at.

The challenger increase, but well secured. Still be careful! Personally, I felt it more difficult than up.

The Höllental between Schneeberg and Rax is one of the most idyllic places in the Vienna Alps. Not only because the fresh Schwarza ensures a special experience, but because hikers also get their money's worth. In gravel bays, sunny and shady cookies can be found.
