Difficult hike. Very good condition required. Mostly easy to walk. Supposure required. The starting point of the tour can be reached by public transport.

A small viewpoint that is on the way to the Stegastein Viewpoint. Already gives a foretaste of the view from above. Good way to rest briefly. ðŸ˜‰

Nice look, but in the evening the shadow lies on the fjord and you can hardly see it.

Turlid waterfall

Hiking highlight

A hidden jewel among all sights from Aurland / FlÃ¥m. This waterfall is neither visible in the most visited parts of Aurland nor on the way there, which means that only a small number of people visit it. Although it is not as popular as some other waterfalls in this region, I would more than recommend it to see it. If time allows, there is also the possibility to follow the path to Stegastein.

The path can be very wet and slippery below the waterfall, and you can hardly miss an unwanted shower.
