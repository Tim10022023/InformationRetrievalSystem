Stuvdalsvatnet

Hiking highlight

Stuvdalsvatnet is one of the lakes where you come by on the way to the Munkebu hut and the beautiful Munken. Beautiful views await you on this section. On the way there is a rock level that has to be mastered with a chain - very necessary if the rock is wet and slippery.
