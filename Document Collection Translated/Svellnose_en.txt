The guarded Spiterstulen hut is one of the largest in the National Park in Jotunheim. It can be reached across the street and is ideal as a base camp for exploring the park.

The shelter has a wide range of accommodations, from single rooms to multi -bed rooms. It is also possible to use the campsite equipped with sanitary facilities on the other side of the river.

The restaurant in the refuge is excellent and serves local dishes. Also do not hesitate to try the Lomb, a beer that is brewed in the village of Lom, just a few kilometers away.

After all, the location is very busy during the high season. Do not hesitate to make a reservation to secure your place.
