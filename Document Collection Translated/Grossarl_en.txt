Under the hut you will find an old water wheel that was previously used to stir butter. This small town is a paradise for children - the brook, a tiny pond, a diverse playground as well as free -range cats, dogs and ducks. While the big ones relax with regionally made delicacies such as bread, butter, cheese, bacon and sausage at the snack, the little ones can let off steam on the premises.

Suddenly it gets high alpine up here. The trees deviate back, the underground becomes more and more uneven and the path increases on a slope. If you turn around, you can enjoy a magnificent view over the Großarl Valley.

Nice view down into the Salzach valley, with a view of the Hochkönig and the surrounding mountains.
