Rheinquelle - Lai da Tuma

Hiking highlight

We were on the Rhine cycle path from Andermatt to Karlsruhe. Of course, this also includes the hike to the official Rheinquelle, the Lai da Tuma. It is a small high mountain lake that collects the water of many sources. From the lake, the Gebirgsbach Vorderrhein is called. At Reichenau in Switzerland, the front and back rhine finally flow together and from here it is called the Rhine. It was very nice to have stood on the source of this large river.
