Knorrhütte

A rustic hut of the Alpine Club in the middle of the scree field in front of the Zugspitze. Here you have a beautiful view of the green Rein Valley, but also on the rocky peaks of the surrounding mountains. Kindly, you can also fill up your water supplies here. 😊

If you want to pause a little longer here, you can stay in the small restaurant for eating or spend the night in the hut. A little break, whether short or long, should be planned in any case. 😉

The Zugspitzplatt can be visited via the descent on the dangerous scree slope, or with the glacier railway, the Zugspitze and the Kaarstlandschaft, almost 400 meters deeper, from which the cogwalk continues to Garmisch.

Zugspitze summit

Hiking highlight

2137 of 2198 wandering recommend this

If you plan to climb the Zugspitze from Ehrwald and take the train back down, you should inquire about the operating times of the Tyrolean Zugspitzbahn beforehand.

A fondue evening takes place several times a month on the Zugspitze, where the train runs until 9:30 p.m. So you can take your time when you climb and escape the big hustle and bustle if you only reach the summit after 5 p.m.

The train can of course also be used if you do not take part in the fondue evening. The ticket can be bought right before the trip starts at the summit. So when the weather is nice you can admire the wonderful sunset on the Zugspitze and the summit belongs all alone, with a little luck.

Information on the extended operating times is available on the Tiroler Zugspitzbahn website under the heading "Events".
