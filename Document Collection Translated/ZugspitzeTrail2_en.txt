Zugspitze summit

Hiking highlight

If you plan to climb the Zugspitze from Ehrwald and take the train back down, you should inquire about the operating times of the Tyrolean Zugspitzbahn beforehand.

A fondue evening takes place several times a month on the Zugspitze, where the train runs until 9:30 p.m. So you can take your time when you climb and escape the big hustle and bustle if you only reach the summit after 5 p.m.

The train can of course also be used if you do not take part in the fondue evening. The ticket can be bought right before the trip starts at the summit. So when the weather is nice you can admire the wonderful sunset on the Zugspitze and the summit belongs all alone, with a little luck.

Information on the extended operating times is available on the Tiroler Zugspitzbahn website under the heading "Events".

The via ferrata is absolutely feasible even without a via ferrata set 😊

The Zugspitzplatt can be visited via the descent on the dangerous scree slope, or with the glacier railway, the Zugspitze and the Kaarstlandschaft, almost 400 meters deeper, from which the cogwalk continues to Garmisch.

Via ferrata stopper

Hiking highlight

294 of 303 wandering recommend this

The stopper is a simple via ferrata (A/B). Experiences do not need a via ferrata setting here, but a helmet is recommended, however, because preceding stones can be kicked off. Occasionally, water runs down the rock, which makes the inspection a little more difficult. A nightly climb with a headlamp is also possible without any problems.

Wiener-Neustädter-Hütte

Hiking highlight

Great, rustic hut. The view of the Zugspitze and the valley (especially at sunset) is amazing. The rooms and mattresses are in very good condition. The host is very friendly and the prices for a mountain hut are quite cheap. At dinner there is a choice between vegetarian and with meat, whereby you can get a look up free of charge. There is a good breakfast buffet in the morning. Around a nice experience.
