Beautiful mountain lake in the middle of the Alpstein, with a panorama that could not have been created better on the computer. Free -running cows, light green sparkling water, cheese dairy, alphorn players ... heart, what more do you want?

At the Mesmer there is great all -round view down to the Seealpsee, towards Schäfler and the Säntis. Restaurant with traditional dishes, e.g. Rösti with bratwurst, and with a terrace for eating or just lingering with a suure mosque.
