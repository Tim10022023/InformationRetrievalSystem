Hiking highlight

The Nova Valley is a remote high valley above Gaschurn. It runs in parallel to the Illtal and is flowed through by the Vermielbach. In the middle of the valley is the Alpe Nova, where you can enjoy wonderful, homemade Sura Kees.

From here you have a fantastic view of the Nova Valley, the Madrisella and to the Silvretta reservoir. 360-degree panorama, simply beautiful, and worth every vertical meter

The way there requires sure -footedness and good shoes, but is still suitable for newcomers. It makes sense to drive the gondola to the mountain station and then take a summit round with a great view of the valley.

Great view. The path is part of a tightrope walk. So you should be free of dizziness.

Supposure required. Stones sometimes very loose. In doubt, the climb can also be avoided
