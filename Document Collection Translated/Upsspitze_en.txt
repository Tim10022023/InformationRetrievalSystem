The upspitze (2,332 meters) is a secondary summit from the well-known Daniel and it is advisable to take you with you within a small round tour with a Daniel ascent.

The view from Daniel is just fantastic. You can see directly on the Zugspitze. The view over the entire valley and the mountains is so impressive that you would like to stay at the top.

For the transition from the upper tip to Daniel, you should be sure -footed and free of dizziness. However, the transition is not as difficult as the first impression of the Upspitze gives it.
The path usually runs on the right of the ridge and calls for a short hand of hand when overcoming a rock level. However, the difficulties do not exceed the 1st degree of climbing. You should be careful anyway.

Great alp at almost 1,500m height with a fantastic view over Lermoos and Ehrwald. Very good cuisine with a rustic dining room.
