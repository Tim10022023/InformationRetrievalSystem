The Nuremberg H√ºtte is definitely one of my favorites. I was there on the Stubaier H√∂henweg and on a separate tour to the Wilder Freiger. It is also a base at the transition to Italy. During my last visit I got to know a couple that spent his wedding day here. Who can blame them, the wildly romantic hut also offers double rooms and the surroundings and calm here could not be more beautiful here.

There is a via ferrata and climbing garden near the hut, the hut owner is a ski and mountain guide and is always available to advise if you have any questions. Simply a great hut, which also offers delicious self and with lots of your own food. A wonderful all-round package.

From glaciers spanning lake with swimming option. Or just to chill in a quiet place. A detour from Nuremberg is definitely worth it.

Lonely summit in the Stubai Alps on the border between Tyrol and South Tyrol. From here you have an excellent view of the glaciers of the Stubai Alps.
