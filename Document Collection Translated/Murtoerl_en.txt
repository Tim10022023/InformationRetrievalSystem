Kreealm chapel

Hiking highlight

Recommended by 64 wandering

This small chapel lies on the way to the Kreealmen. It invites you to hold and get still. At the same time, it shows the tired hiker that the way to the two alpine pastures is no longer far.

Kreealm-KreehÃ¼tte

Hiking highlight

66 of 68 wandering recommend this

The lower of the two Kreealms is the Kreealm KreehÃ¼tte at 1,483 meters. In around an hour and a half you can reach this hut on the hiking trail or along the forest path. A piece in front of the hut is a small chapel that briefly stimulates pause. (Source: Grossarltal.info).

We visited the lower of the two Kreealms on the way back. At the Kreealm BichlhÃ¼tte (the above Kreealm) there was a very delicious kaaspress dumpling soup and then the dessert: very delicious blackberry cake. But be careful: for the way here you need a certain level of condition and should not be completely untrained. The way is pulling!

The upper of the two Kreealms in the Hohe Tauern National Park. The climb is not without, but very nice, since there are always beautiful views of the wide landscape.
