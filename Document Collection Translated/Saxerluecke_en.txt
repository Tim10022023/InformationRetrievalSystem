Berggasthaus Plattenbödeli since 1911 at 1284 m. M.
Unique landscape in the Alpstein.
1911 - bought the box host Jos. Anton Dörig «Mattle» (great-grandfather of the Hans and Grandfather of Meglisalp Mile) at the exit of the Brüeltobel a piece of floor at the exit of the Brüeltobel and soon built daughter Franziska Inauen-Dörig.
1917 - handover to daughter Franziska Fritsche -dr.
1930 - Alfred Fritsche built today's inn.
1934 - The electric light burned for the first time on the plate bödeli, operated with a diesel engine single cylinder and an örlikon battery.
1958 - Son Hans and Alice Fritsche -Hilderegger buys the company. In order to fix the water shortage, a 1000m long line from the Alp Rainhütte was moved through the lake. The source is 60m higher than the plate bödeli and thus the water flows into the reservoir with back pressure. The diesel system has been enlarged and a washing machine and a washing machine were set up.
1964 - The hem path through the Brüeltobel is expanded as a road.
1971-Extension of the kitchen, conversion of the toilet facilities and renovation of the restaurant with self-service buffet. The main entrance is moved to the sunny side and the terrace is expanded. A separate sewage treatment plant is built and the diesel system is renewed.
2022 - Purchase of the mountain inn by Alois and Manuela Inauen Sager.

Berggasthaus stauber
High above the St.Gallen Rhine Valley stands on the eastern ridge of the Alpstein, above Frümsen, the mountain inn Staubern at 1751 M.Ü.M. The overwhelming view with a view of four countries (CH - FL - AT - D) is surrounded by an intact mountain flora.
The panorama on the dust ridge is unique in its diversity. On the one hand, the view extends far over the Rhine Valley to Lake Constance and numerous peaks from nearby countries are within sight. On the other hand, there is a wonderful view of large parts of the Alpstein Mountains.
