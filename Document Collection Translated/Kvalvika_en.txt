Norway has some of the world's most spectacular fjords. Here you can enjoy a panoramic view of the rugged islands and the glittering water that defines this landscape.

The combination of Ryten and Kvalvika Beach is more than worthwhile. Indescribable prospects

Almost the entire route to the summit offers great views! (And also the descent to the beach.)

Kvalvika (swing)

Hiking highlight

Bolded by Rauen Bergen and about two hours of walk from the next street, this lofotic beach jewel is located. Kvalvika comprises two sandy beaches, fjords and juicy pastures separated from a rock adorn the hinterland. Unaffected and mostly deserted, Kvalvika is worth the effort of the hike. The jump into the water is mandatory

The view from this side of the route does not affect the view from the beach side.
