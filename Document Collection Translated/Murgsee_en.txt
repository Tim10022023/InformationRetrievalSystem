Murgseen (Oberer Murgsee / Mittlerer Murgsee / Unterer Murgsee)
Three Bergseeperlen in the Murgtal (Oberer Murgsee / Mittlerer Murgsee / Unterer Murgsee) in Eastern Switzerland SG / GL
The three Murgseen are embedded in a wildly romantic valley boiler. The Lower Murgsee is located in the middle of a protected Arven reserve, the scenery is reminiscent of the wilderness of Canada. Between the middle and upper Murgsee there is the Murgsee mountain inn, which in addition to hikers also houses Fischer. The Murgsee trout is known for their pink, salmon-like meat.
The shortest, best and easiest way to Murgsee leads via Murg am Walensee, located on the Zurich - Chur route, either by car or the Murgtalbus (registration for bus trips at Taxi Walensee, Tel. 079 735 30 00) to the Mornen car park (P2). The journey via Murg is well signposted. From Mornen, an approx. 1.5 m wide natural gravel path leads directly to the Murgsee mountain restaurant at 1825 MÃ¼m. The hiking time is approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.
The Murgsee - MÃ¼rschen area circular hike is particularly recommended, with the starting point of the Merlen car park (P1) in the Murgtal. The hiking trails are well marked and is also suitable for hikers with little experience.
