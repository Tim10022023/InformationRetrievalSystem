A small part of the path to the Purtscheller Haus. There are around 580 levels. These lead over a mushy cow pasture, so the shoes remain clean and dry.

Nice house with great views on the national border. You can choose whether you enjoy your summit beer in Bavaria or Austria. ðŸ˜ƒ

At the end of the actual hiking trail (the climbing path continues towards the high GÃ¶ll) is a nice place to enjoy this wonderful landscape. About 20 minutes from the Purtschellerhaus, sure -footedness and sturdy shoes are required.

Here you can take a short break in the shade. There is enough space to leave other hikers.

One of the most beautiful summit crosses in the Alps. It is difficult to achieve that you should plan around six hours to climb back fire. The view is absolutely great.

Both the Salzburger Weg and the German Weg are great, super exhausting, but worthwhile. German path up, Salzburger Weg down - would be my tip.
