Important for camper: There is a nice campsite that has unfortunately been closed for 2 years, as it is said for official reasons.
The parking lot itself is open and also offers a toilet for 3 euros a day and is a good starting point for the waterfalls, as well as the Dornbachhorn.

Very nice place in the valley between Sonntaghorn and Peitingköpfl. With snow it is almost impossible to find the real way, snowshoes are recommended

Sunday horn

Hiking highlight

The Sunday horn is a beautiful panoramic summit on the border between Germany and Austria. You have a beautiful view of the Chiemgau as well as the Kaiser Mountains, the Loferer Steinberge and the Berchtesgaden Alps. It leads several routes up to the summit, the increase from the Austrian side is the simplest and leads from the Heutal to the summit first through a forest to the Hochalm and then over serpentines.
The increase in the German side is far more demanding and begins in Laubau. From there, the path leads first to the Schwarzachenalm and then through the very beautiful but also steep rear Kraxenbach valley and then very steeply straight up through the scree under the summit up to the ridge.
