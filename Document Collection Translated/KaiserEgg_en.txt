Alp show cheese dairy with buvette. The route from the Salzmatt to the Riggisalp is also often used by bikers. Briefly above the hut there is a little soul.

With the Riggisalpseelein you can see neither an inflow nor an outflow. So I wouldn't necessarily swim in this standing water.

Kaiseregg

The kicks and steps in front of the pass are worthwhile. When you arrive on the Kaiseregpass you have a wonderful meadow and you can see for the first time towards the Bernese and Valais Alps. The Kaiseregg summit is no longer far and the route is no longer very exhausting. Goal achieved :-)

The Kaisereggalp is below us, from where (past the two Walopseen) you get to Boltigen.
