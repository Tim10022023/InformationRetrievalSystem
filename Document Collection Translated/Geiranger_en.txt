Medium -heavy hike. Good basic condition required. Mostly easy to walk. Supposure required. The starting point of the tour is directly at a parking lot.

Nice waterfall in the middle of Geiranger, tons of water and when climbing you definitely get wet !!
Otherwise mega beautiful and a 'climb' value

The place is surprisingly small and you can hardly imagine how things are going here when several cruise ships land here thousands of visitors. At the end of May 22, it was very nice and quiet over two days.

Unimaginable how people lived up here earlier. Of 3 huts there are still 2. Perfect space for a rest after the strenuous climb
