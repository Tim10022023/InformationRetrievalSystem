Monte Brè

Hiking highlight

Monte Brè is the sunniest mountain in Switzerland. The magnificent view of the bay of the Ceresio, the Alps and the Monte Rose and the countless hiking opportunities make it a preferred destination between art and nature.

Along the forested path at half the slope that connects the Alpe Boglia with Brè, a panoramic view of Lugano and its Golf opens unexpectedly.

Crossing point for several routes, especially towards Monte Boglia, Dente Della Vecchia and Val Solda. Ideal to plan a stopover before continuing the excursion.

Alpe Bolla

Hiking highlight

62 of 63 wandering recommend this

The Alpe Bolla is an alp at 1,129 m above sea level. With a mountain hut in the lower Val Colla, above the city of Cadro, canton of Ticino. It can be easily reached from Cadro, Cureggia or Brèsaldesago on a comfortable, marked path through the middle of the forest. The Capanna Alpe Bolla offers food and drinks, but a reservation is recommended due to the limited seats.
