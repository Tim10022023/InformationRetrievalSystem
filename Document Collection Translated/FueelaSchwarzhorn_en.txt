Flüelapass

Hiking highlight

The road winds over the Füelapass at over 2,300 meters. It runs between Davos and the Engadin, but is only open in the summer months. The European main water sheath runs through the mountain pass, which is passing into the Albula Alps and the Silvretta.

Only rise in summer and in good weather. The climb is short, but it has it all. Ruard and rubble and increasing incline to the Schwarzhornfurgga. From there you should examine the further course to the summit. The difficulties remain about the same, but the height and a few airy areas and views are added. ;-)
