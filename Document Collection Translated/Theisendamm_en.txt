We spontaneously turned from the hiking route because the dam can be used for public bathing. An absolute dream at 25 degrees. A few meters further from the simple entry, is still a quiet corner, perfect for a short cooling from hiking.

From up here you really have a nice view of the city and the sea. Take the time and enjoy the view during a break on the bench!

From the summit the Geitfjellet you have a great view of the Trondheim Bay and the city. Due to the proximity to the city, the cliff is also well attended.
