The Höllentalklamm near Grainau, Hammersbach district, is a real experience. It goes up a lot before you reach the entrance to the gorge. Due to the unique gorge with its many waterfalls, small tunnels and illuminated corridors, the nature lover finds an unforgettable natural spectacle.

In the snow -free time, around mid -May to late October, the gorge is open 24 hours a day. Please do not forget the corresponding clothing, because it is a rather damp matter in the gorge and even in summer the temperatures are sometimes cool. The Höllentalangerhütte at 1,387 meters then invites you to stop. You can also stay here. There are dry rooms for clothing, it should even get too wet. Further ascents from the Höllentalangerhütte are possible, such as the Alpspitze, the Matheisenkar or even on the Zugspitze. Information at: grainau.de/hoelletalklamm.

The hut is amazing. The food and staff great. Just a little expensive, but not a lot either
