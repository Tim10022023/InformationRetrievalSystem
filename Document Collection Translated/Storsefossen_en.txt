Waterfall Storseterfossen (Geiranger)

Hiking highlight

556 of 559 wandering recommend this

The Storseerofssen at a height of 550 meters above Geiranger is an approx. 30 m high waterfall, which can be reached with a slight hike. There are 2 different ways for this, but they run together again, so that you can go differently on the way back and forth. This hike also offers refreshments (perhaps on the way back in the Westeras Farm) and natural great views of the fjord, the harbor and the surrounding mountains.
