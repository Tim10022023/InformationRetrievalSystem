The LAGH da SciSpadus lies between the lakes Saoso and viola and leads up to the viola pass. It has an elongated, egg -shaped shape and is surrounded by large trees that are reflected in the blue and purple water together with the surrounding peaks. In the distance you can see the Palù glacier in the Bernina group.
