Heinrich Gith Steig

Hiking highlight (section)

37 of 39 wandering recommend this

The Heinrich Gith Steig leads from time to time in the fall line through a tree landscape typical of the Wienerwald. It is a romantic increase in all seasons. However, since the Schöpfl belongs to the sandstone forest forest, it is particularly possible to expect moral passages after more intensive rain phases.

The very promising "matras station" is recommended on the Schöpfl. After feast for the eyes, we go to the Schöpflhütte to the delicacies.

The second highest point in the Wienerwald, not far from the Gföhlberghütte and only a short detour from the Waldmarkweg.
