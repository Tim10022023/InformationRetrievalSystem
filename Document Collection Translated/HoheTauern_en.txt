Detmolder Grat

Hiking highlight

Recommended by 3 wandering

The Detmolder Grat is one, sometimes with steel rope insured, high alpine climb. Please only celebrate with alpine equipment (via ferrata set, helmet, climbing strap) and corresponding experience. The climb is one of the highest people in Austria and therefore particularly demanding.
