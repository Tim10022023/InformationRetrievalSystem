Chalet

Hiking highlight

66 of 67 wandering recommend this

Embedded in the heart of the Greyerzland, at 1642 meters above sea level, the chalet Grat is an authentic mountain resort at the foot of the imposing hospitable, the "Dolomites of Switzerland". Here you can enjoy local specialties such as Rösti or Fondue Moitié-Moitié, prepared over the wood fire, and admire a spectacular Alpine panorama. If you want to extend the experience, you will find a quiet break in the cozy rooms with a summit. Whether for a relaxing break, a hike or a night under the starry sky, the chalet Grat is the ideal starting point to experience the mountains.

Here you can find this unusual rock formation. The column opens like a window into the nature of the area and creates a wonderful contrast between a lunar landscape and green areas.

Chalet you soldier

Hiking highlight

The area around the majestic chain of the hostless is a real natural paradise and the soldier's house is right in the middle of it. Regardless of whether it is a cozy hike or demanding climbing route, every mountain enthusiast will find the right one. On the terrace you can taste a warming soup, delicious Swiss cheese or fresh rösti. The soldier's hut has 80 sleeping places, divided into dormitories with four to 16 beds.

The chalet is open every weekend every weekend in summer from June 1st to the end of October and in winter between mid -December and the end of May. There is also a charging station for electrobics.
