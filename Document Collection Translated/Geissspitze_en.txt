The Golmer Joch can be reached relatively quickly from the mountain station; A detour is always worthwhile because of the great view!

The Golmer Höhenweg is known for its continuous view of the Zimba, Kirchlispitzen, Drusenfluh, three towers and the Sulzfluh.
The Golm adventure mountain is located in the middle of the breathtaking mountain backdrop of the Rätikon and is one of the most beautiful hiking areas ever. No matter whether family -friendly hiking route or more demanding Golmer Höhenweg - pleasure hikers and endurance athletes can find a suitable terrain here

Nice wamdering. Descent of Geisspitz gets a little knee. Sticks recommended

Geißspitze (2,334 m)

Hiking highlight

Recommended by 230 wandering

Great panoramic view from the Geißspitze on Drusenfluh, Sulzfluh & Co.
The summit is part of the beautiful balancing hike "Golmer Höhenweg" from the Golmer mountain station to the Lindauer Hütte.
There is a place in the promotion that requires a height of heights and sure -footedness because it goes directly over the ridge. But can be avoided below!

They are nice to look at, but climbing up is too big for us flat countries

Lindauer Hütte

Hiking highlight

856 of 874 wandering recommend this

This large, wonderful mountain hut is located above Tschagguns, in the middle of the Montafon. The view into the mountains of the Rätikon is gigantic.

The Lindauer hut is very well equipped. Cozy double rooms and the hut -owned sauna are just two points that make the hearts of couples beat faster.

But not only in summer, because in winter you can go a wonderful slide here. You can get more information about the Lindauer Hütte here: lindauerhuette.at

The myth tree

Hiking highlight

Here a spruce stands upside down on the side of the path and stretches its bald roots into the sky. The trunk littered with carvings is the myth tree. He connects this by the world of myths.
